## Requirements

There are a few things that you will need to have set up in order to run Gitamin:

- A web server: **Nginx**, **Apache** (with mod_rewrite), or **Lighttpd**
- **PHP 5.6.4+** with the following extensions: mbstring, pdo_mysql
- **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**
- **Composer**

## Installation

By default Hifone comes with a .env.example file. You'll need to rename this file to just .env regardless of what environment you're working on.

If you're using SQLite then your .env file should not contain a DB_HOST key. You'll also need to touch ./database/hifone.sqlite and give it the required permissions.

Directories within the `storage` and the `bootstrap/cache` directories should be writable by your web server or Hifone will not run. 


### Step 1: Shell

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Hifone/Hifone
cd Hifone

cp .env.example .env
vi .env  # write database settings

composer install --no-dev -o

php artisan hifone:install

chmod -R 777 storage
chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 777 public/uploads
```

### Step 2: Browser

Now go to http://your_site_domain/ and have fun!

## Installing Hifone with Docker

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Hifone/Docker.git hifone-docker
$ cd hifone-docker
$ docker build -t hifone --rm .
$ docker run -it --rm -p 0.0.0.0:8081:80 hifone
$ /run.sh
```
Now go to http://127.0.0.1:8081 (linux) or http://192.168.99.100:8081 (mac) and have fun!
